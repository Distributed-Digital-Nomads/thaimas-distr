<b>1. Personal Data and Privacy Policy</b><br>
<i>*extracted from the Terms and Conditions of Use of the BomEbo Application</i><br>
<br>
1.1. BomEbo, as an iol-app, does not possess its own servers or user data storage. Instead, it functions as a graphical interface in the form of a mobile application designed to access the Internet of Labour platform (iol) with its own custom settings, which include a list of services limited exclusively to massage services.<br>
<br>
1.2. BomEbo prompts users to enter only the data necessary to receive or provide services. This means that BomEbo requests from users only public data, which is displayed to other users for the purpose of facilitating services between them.<br>
<br>
1.3. Any data provided within BomEbo is transmitted to the Internet of Labour platform. To exchange data with the platform, BomEbo utilizes the open-source `iolNet` module. The `iolNet` module may only perform data exchanges between BomEbo and iol in a secure manner, in accordance with the iol protocol:<br>
• Communication via the iol protocol uses a unique TLS/SSL encryption for every connection and does not utilize http/https.<br>
• Graphical information, such as photos/images, is protected by the iol platform and is accessible only within iol-apps; furthermore, the delivery of graphical information to BomEbo uses a unique, one-time token for each connection.<br>
• Application updates use highly reliable channels to prevent attempts by third parties, including Google Play and mobile device manufacturers, to interfere with user data from BomEbo and iol. To ensure this, it is essential to comply with section 4.0. of the Terms and Conditions of Use of the BomEbo Application.<br>
<br>
1.4. The enhanced protection of iol-app user data, including that of BomEbo, is also linked to the protection of Human Rights. Additional information regarding the observance of Human Rights concerning the right to privacy and private relationships is available in section 3.0. of the Terms and Conditions of Use of the BomEbo Application.<br>
